Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. 
These containers encapsulate everything an application needs to run, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. 
Docker containers are isolated from each other and from the underlying host system, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across different environments. 
In Kubernetes (K8s), Docker containers are often used as the runtime environment for application workloads. 
Kubernetes manages the deployment, scaling, and operation of these containers, 
orchestrating them across a cluster of compute nodes to ensure high availability, scalability, and resilience of the applications. 
By leveraging Docker containers within Kubernetes, developers can easily deploy and manage complex microservices-based applications with efficiency and agility.
