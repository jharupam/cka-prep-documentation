Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. 
These containers encapsulate everything an application needs to run, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. 
Docker containers are isolated from each other and from the underlying host system, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across different environments. 
In Kubernetes (K8s), Docker containers are often used as the runtime environment for application workloads. 
Kubernetes manages the deployment, scaling, and operation of these containers, 
orchestrating them across a cluster of compute nodes to ensure high availability, scalability, and resilience of the applications. 
By leveraging Docker containers within Kubernetes, developers can easily deploy and manage complex microservices-based applications with efficiency and agility.



# Use an existing Docker image as a base
FROM node:14-alpine
# FROM node:14-alpine: This line specifies the base image to use for the container. In this case, it's a lightweight Alpine Linux-based image with Node.js version 14 installed.

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app
#WORKDIR /app: Sets the working directory inside the container where subsequent commands will be executed.

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./
#COPY package*.json ./: Copies package.json and package-lock.json from the host machine to the working directory inside the container.

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install
#RUN npm install: Runs the npm install command inside the container to install dependencies specified in package.json.

# Copy the rest of the application files to the working directory
COPY . .
#COPY . .: Copies the rest of the application files from the host machine to the working directory inside the container.

# Expose port 3000 to the outside world
EXPOSE 3000
#EXPOSE 3000: Exposes port 3000 on the container to allow communication with the outside world.

# Command to run the application when the container starts
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
#CMD ["node", "index.js"]: Specifies the command to run when the container starts. In this case, it runs the Node.js application file index.js using the Node.js runtime.
